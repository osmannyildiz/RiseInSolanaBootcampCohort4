## Deployment

2. Create the files (`lib.rs`, `instructions.rs`, `state.rs`) and paste their contents.
3. Adjust the Borsh import as described in the comment in `lib.rs` line 6.
4. Build and deploy.
5. (Optional) Copy the program ID and replace the address in the frontend project. Search for "`REVIEW_PROGRAM_ID =`" to find where to paste.
